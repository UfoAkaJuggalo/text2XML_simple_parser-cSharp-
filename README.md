# Text2XML (a simple parser in C#)

### **C#, WPF** 

---

A simple parser that parses text (sentences, words) to XML.

In future, it will be more *generic* and will support more custom rules and tags (not only **XML** but also **HTML** with attributes, or any other tags) and all of this will be customized via **JSON** *dictionary* files.
